It is used in Machine Learning to calculate how well a model (something that\nmakes a prediction) does at making predictions.</p>\n<h3>How do I calculate MAE?</h3>\n<p>In order to calculate MAE, you must first calculate the absolute error for each data point. To do this just subtract\nthe actual value from the predicted value and take the absolute value of the result. Then, take the average of the\nresulting absolute errors.</p>\n<h3>How do I use MAE?</h3>\n<p>MAE is most useful when comparing one model to another. Unlike some other error metrics there isn’t a “magic”\nnumber to target. For example, a MAE of 10 might be good when the expected range is over 100. However, that\nsame\nvalue\nof 10 might not be as good if the expected maximum is 15.</p>\n<p>You can use MAE to compare two models, though. If one model has a MAE of 100 and a second model has a MAE of 175\nthen\nthe first model performs better on average.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Is MAE","date":"January 20, 2020","description":"Simple definition of what MAE is and its general application."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-is-mae/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/who-to-follow/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Who to Follow"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-mape/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is MAPE"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
