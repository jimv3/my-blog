I don’t know if there is the same, or at least similar, phrase around the world. Here in the United States, however, it is a phrase that is fairly common, especially among folks my age (not telling) or older.</p>\n<p>For the longest time, at least until today, my understanding of the phrase was that you needed to beat the other birds. If you were late to the game the other birds would have gotten the worm. From childhood on I viewed this as a competition. I have to be better, faster, than the other birds. If I wait then someone else will get my worm.</p>\n<p>But then today happened. I was out for my daily walk and I saw a worm on the sidewalk. This isn’t an uncommon thing but it prompted me to think about the old saying, “The early bird gets the worm”. Today it struck me differently. What if all this time I was thinking about “beating” other birds to the proverbial punch but what I really should be focused on is seizing the opportunity to get the worm. See, the worm will go back underground as the sun comes up. It is much more difficult to get worms from under the earth rather than when they are right on top.</p>\n<p>All this time I was thinking I had to beat other birds to get my share. In reality, all I had to do was take advantage of the opportunity that presented itself. It doesn’t matter whether I am the first bird. There is plenty to go around. But you do have to show up while the chance is present.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Early Bird Gets the Worm","date":"April 15, 2021","description":"It isn't about beating the other birds, it is about seizing the opportunity"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/early-bird/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/state-of-mind/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Senior Engineer - Title Or State Of Mind?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/github-copilot/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thoughts on GitHub Copilot"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
