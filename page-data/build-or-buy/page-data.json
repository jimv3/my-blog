You <em>always</em> build so you have control of the software. It did not matter if the thing to be built was a library or an application. Every time I was in a meeting with management to discuss whether we should purchase a package or license a library, my brain screamed “BUILD IT!“. Now, I take a more nuanced approach and I don’t always come to the same conclusion. </p>\n<p>Here a my thoughts on when to build and when to buy:<br>\n<strong>Build if</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The software is your core business/competency</li>\n<li>You gain an competitive advantage from the software</li>\n<li>The cost of purchasing is extremely prohibitive</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Buy if</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The software is not your core business/competency</li>\n<li>There is no competitive advantage to be gained from the software</li>\n<li>The cost of purchasing is almost the same as building</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One factor I didn’t think about as a young developer is the cost of ownership. If you build a library, for example, that has regulatory implications, your company will spend a lot of money keeping the software up-to-date due to changes in regulations. Someone will have to monitor the regulations, interpret their findings, and help the development team translate the requirements into code.</p>\n<p>Another example is inventory management. This is a well understood problem and there are many packages that can help with inventory management that keep your development team free to work on unique business problems. The only time you should build an inventory management system is if the cost is prohibitive or that system is in fact what your business offers as a product/service.</p>\n<p>Before jumping to build new software, consider the factors above and make a wise decision.</p>\n<p>If I left out other factors please leave a comment.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Build or Buy","date":"February 27, 2021","description":"My thoughts on when you should build software versus when you should buy software"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/build-or-buy/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/senior-engineer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Senior Engineer"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/best-first-language/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is The Best First Programming Language To Learn?"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
