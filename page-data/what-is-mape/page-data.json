It is used in Machine Learning to help determine how well a model (something that\nmakes a prediction) does at making predictions.</p>\n<h3>How do I calculate MAPE?</h3>\n<p>In order to calculate MAPE, you must first calculate the absolute percentage error for each data point. To do this\njust subtract the actual value from the predicted value, divide by the actual value, and take the absolute value of the\nresult. Then, take the average of the resulting absolute percentage errors.</p>\n<h3>How do I use MAPE?</h3>\n<p>MAPE is useful when comparing one model to another. Also, you can decide what percentage error would be acceptable on\naverage and go with a model that is within the acceptable range.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What Is MAPE","date":"January 25, 2020","description":"A simple definition of what MAPE is and its general application."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-is-mape/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-mae/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Is MAE"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/bootcamp-vs-university/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coding Bootcamp, University, or Self-taught"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
