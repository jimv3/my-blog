It is related to <a href=\"/what-is-mae\">MAE</a>, or Mean Absolute Error. It is an\nerror metric typically used to rate machine learning models for Time Series data.</p>\n<h3>How do I calculate MASE?</h3>\n<p>To calculate MASE you must first get the MAE of the naive model. The naive model just takes the previous period’s\nvalue and uses it as the prediction for the current period. Next, you calculae the MAE for the new model. Finally,\ndivide the MAE for the new model by the MAE for the naive model.</p>\n<h3>How do I use MASE?</h3>\n<p>MASE will tell you how well a model performs against the naive model. A score of &#x3C; 1.0 means the model outperforms\nthe naive model (in terms of MAE). A score of 1.0 means the models perform equally. A score of > 1.0 means the new\nmodel underperforms the naive model (again in terms of MAE).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is MASE","date":"March 14, 2020","description":"A simple definition of what MASE is and its general application."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/what-is-mase/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/imposter-syndrome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Imposter Syndrome"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/confusion-matrix/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Confusion Matrix and Its Uses"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
