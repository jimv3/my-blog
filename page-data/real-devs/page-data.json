And, my thoughts on why they are misinformed.</p>\n<h2>Real Devs…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t use a mouse</li>\n<li>Don’t copy and paste code</li>\n<li>Don’t use tabs</li>\n<li>Know every command in <em>xxx</em> framework</li>\n<li>Use Linux/Mac/Windows</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don’t use a mouse</h3>\n<p>My first question is why not? I know many people say learing keyboard shortcuts is the way to improve your productivity and speed. Sometimes that is probably accurate. But for shortcuts that aren’t used very often, or if they key combination is cumbersome, I say go for the mouse.</p>\n<h3>Don’t copy and paste code</h3>\n<p>I totally disagree with this statement given a couple of caveats. First, DO NOT copy and paste code if you don’t understand what it is doing and how. Second, give attribution. Third, make sure you rename variables and functions to fit with the rest of your code.</p>\n<h3>Don’t use tabs</h3>\n<p>This one can turn into a religious war pretty quickly. I used to be in the spaces-not-tabs camp until I read about people who sometimes have vision impairments and using tabs allows them to work more effectively. The hardest part about this one is you have to convince an entire team to switch unless you work alone. Also, if there are cases when the language you develop in mandates spaces rather than tabs your options are taken off the table.</p>\n<h3>Know every command in <em>xxx</em> framework</h3>\n<p>You don’t have to remember every command or function available in the framework you are using. You have a search engine at your disposal and these days most editors can help autocomplete your code. If you understand what you want to do and how the framework you are using normally names things, you can get most of the help you need right in the editor itself.</p>\n<h3>Use Linux/Mac/Windows (or some other operating system or tool)</h3>\n<p>Don’t get caught up in this argument. All tools (OS, editor, etc.) have a purpose for which they are fit. There are always tradeoffs. Weigh the pros and cons then make a decision that you are happy with. Do you prefer Linux over Windows? Great, choose it for the things you like. Want to use Windows instead of Mac to get a broader reach? No problem. If you are happy with Windows then don’t worry with what other people say.</p>\n<p>Do you have something to add or disagree with my statemens?
