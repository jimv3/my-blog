Most of the articles I come across mainly approach TDD from the perspective of creating a greenfield, or brand new, application. What about existing apps or features? Can TDD still be applied?</p>\n<p>The short answer is “Yes”! And the good news is the process is basically the same. The biggest difference versus a greenfield application is a larger code base and an (hopefully) existing test suite.</p>\n<p>When you get started the first thing you should do is to run the full test suite to make sure all the tests are currently passing. The main reason you want to make sure the current tests all pass is so you can be sure the code you write or modify is not the cause of a bug.</p>\n<p>Now that all the existing tests are passing it is time to start on the change. You will still want to follow the red-green-refactor principle here. Either write a new failing test based on a new requirement, or update an existing test based on the change in behavior that has been requested. Once you have a failing test write or modify just enough code to make the test pass. Then rerun the entire suite to make sure no bugs were introduced. Keep repeating this process until you have completed the request.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"TDD For Enhancements","date":"January 23, 2021","description":"TDD for existing applications"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tdd-for-enhancements/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/real-devs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Real Devs..."}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/nothing-new/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nothing New To Say"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
