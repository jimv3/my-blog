Some of the notions apply less, or possibly not at all, to\nsoftware developers working on software as a product.</p>\n<h3>What Is My Role?</h3>\n<p>If you are a software developer for a business then you may think your role is to write code.\nThat is certainly a part of what you do but it is far from being all of it. Writing code is\nnot such a niche job that your company couldn’t possibly find someone else to do it.</p>\n<p>More than just converting specs into software, your role is (or should be) to solve problems. You\njust happen to typically do that by writing code. If you see a job that could be automated or\nsimplified, and you see a way to do that with code, by all means write the code. On the other hand,\nif you see a way to improve the process without writing code then bring that up as well.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Fulfill The Role of Problem Solver?</h3>\n<p>The best way is to learn the business. Figure out what makes your company tick. Why do they exist\nin the first place. That is just the first step, though. You also need to learn what the various\nbusiness units do. While their overarching goal is to make the company money and please customers\nthere are also goals for the individual teams as well as the people that comprise those teams.</p>\n<p>Learn what motivates the teams and its members and you can have a profound affect on the success\nof your company. Not to mention, the value you bring to the table will be sure to get you noticed.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What's My Role?","date":"February 09, 2020","description":"As a business software developer do you ever wonder what your role is?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/whats-my-role/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/bootcamp-vs-university/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Coding Bootcamp, University, or Self-taught"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/imposter-syndrome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Imposter Syndrome"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
