It can impact\nall areas of work and all levels of expertise.</p>\n<h3>What To Do About It</h3>\n<p>In my opinion the best thing to do is make sure imposter syndrome does not cause you\nto miss opportunities for improvement (promotion, leadership, job, etc.). Don’t not\napply for a job because you think you aren’t capable. Now, this does have to be within\nreason. For example, if you have six months of experience then don’t apply for a job\nthat requires 10 years of experience.</p>\n<p>What I am saying though is that the inner-doubt shouldn’t be the thing that holds you\nback from attaining your goals.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Imposter Syndrome","date":"February 27, 2020","description":"Are feelings of imposter syndrome normal?"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/imposter-syndrome/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/whats-my-role/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What's My Role?"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-mase/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is MASE"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
