Do you need external motivation? If so, a bootcamp or university degree is better. If you can stay focused then\nself-teaching may work. Read on to see what I think are some of the benefits and drawbacks to each approach.</p>\n<h3>Why Am I Qualified to Speak on This?</h3>\n<p>First, I have obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science. Second, I have worked with individuals who were self-taught. Third, I have\nworked with individuals who have gone through a coding bootcamp. Finally, I have spent a lot of time speaking with, and mentoring, bootcamp attendees.</p>\n<h3>Self-Taught Programmers</h3>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with being a self-taught software engineer. In fact, I find it admirable that people have the self-discipline required to stick\nwith it. Not everything in software development makes sense. If you go down this path it is almost imperative to find a mentor. There will be times that\nyou get stuck. Having a mentor means you can lean on someone to explain what, why, how, etc.</p>\n<p>Also, spend some time studying code from others. Open source projects are a great place to start. Look at the way various people write code and see if\nyou can find patterns that start to seem repeated.</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will probably remember things because you had to learn it first-hand</li>\n<li>You can have a sense of accomplishment</li>\n<li>You work at your own pace</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You might not learn the “best” way to do things</li>\n<li>You have nothing other than yourself to motivate you</li>\n<li>It isn’t always easy knowing where to start</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>University Degree</h3>\n<p>Going the university degree route is also a viable option. There are professors to teach you the “right” way to do things. The nice thing is you have peers\nwho are going through the same things and might be able to answer questions. Also, some of them will have already taken some of the classes you are currently\nenrolled in and probably have a deeper understanding looking back.</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Peer group</li>\n<li>Built-in mentor via professor(s)</li>\n<li>Breadth of education</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many requirements that may not be related</li>\n<li>Cost - University degrees are only getting more expensive</li>\n<li>Time - Even an associate’s degree will take ~2 years</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Coding Bootcamp</h3>\n<p>Let’s talk about coding bootcamps. I really only have personal experience with one, <a href=\"http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\nNashville Software School</a>, in Nashville, TN. They offer exposure to front-end and back-end development plus some other programs. The program is concentrated\nbut of high quality. The instructors have experience in the industry.</p>\n<p>Similar to a university setting, there are peers to talk through what you are currently learning. The program answers the “where to start” question. There are\nopportunities for networking and meeting people in a welcoming environment where questions are not only allowed but are welcomed.</p>\n<p>Benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shorter timeframe - typically 3-6 months</li>\n<li>No “extra” classes to take</li>\n<li>Knowledgable instructors</li>\n<li>Learn current practices and technologies</li>\n<li>Peer group</li>\n<li>Typically less expensive than a university degree</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawbacks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be intense</li>\n<li>Still requires a level of motivation</li>\n<li>Not as widely available as universities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>My Recommendation</h3>\n<p>Obviously, you will have to figure out what works best for you. Coding bootcamps, in my opinion, strike a great balance between learning and self-sufficiency. You\nwill still have to research and figure some things out but there are guard rails to assist. No matter which route you go you will be setting yourself up for a\nvery rewarding career.</p>\n<h3>P.S.</h3>\n<p>If you go to a coding bootcamp, you will be ready for a software career. You will have the skills necessary to be a productive member on a software team. Even with\na BS in Computer Science there was a LOT I still had to learn at my first job. And some of what I had to learn is taught/explained in the coding bootcamp.
