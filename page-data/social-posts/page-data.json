With that said, here is how I will try to conduct myself when people comment on something I have posted publicly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I respond, I will respond with courtesy. Even if we don’t agree we can still be courteous and try each other graciously.</li>\n<li>I won’t delete your comment or reply unless it is harmful. While I know that may seem ambiguous what I am driving at is that discourse requires multiple view points. However, if you make comments that disparage based on race, sexual orientation, sexual identity, or other personal attributes then I will delete your comment if possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would respectfully ask that you not comment and run. If you start a dialog let’s see it through to completion. There have been times when people made a comment and then virtually fled the scene. If you are unwilling to have a dialog then maybe you shouldn’t start one.</p>\n<p>Please, feel free to start a dialogue and let’s keep it going.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Disourse on Social Platforms","date":"February 10, 2021","description":"My ideas on how I will conduct myself on social platforms"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/social-posts/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/nothing-new/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nothing New To Say"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/senior-engineer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Makes a Senior Engineer"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2677188060","63159454"]}
